## About the choices

### React

I do not believe that it is still worth writing pale front end today that is not in react or vue, extremely lean, light and robust libs. Especially when it comes to prototypes or codes that can be shared with React Native mobile apps

### Validation

I usually use libs for form validation like Yup, in this case I did something very shallow 'on the nail'

### Input mask and date processing

Using the mask was an alternative not to add treatment complexity and date conversion

### Styled-components

And I prefer to use styled-components because of its versatility of using 'sass-on-js'
